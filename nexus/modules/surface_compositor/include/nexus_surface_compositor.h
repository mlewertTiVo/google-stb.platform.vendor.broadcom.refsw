Summary:
per-display settings used in NEXUS_SurfaceCompositorSettings

Description:
When you pass a NEXUS_DisplayHandle, you give up your ability to call certain nexus functions. They are:
- NEXUS_Display_Close
- NEXUS_Display_SetGraphicsSettings
- NEXUS_Display_SetGraphicsFramebuffer
- NEXUS_Display_SetSettings - you cannot change 'format' while SurfaceCompositor is enabled. See NEXUS_SurfaceCompositorSettings.enabled and NEXUS_SurfaceCompositorStatus.active.
- NEXUS_Display_SetVsyncCallback - but only if NEXUS_SurfaceClientSettings.windowMoved is requested

When you pass a NEXUS_VideoWindowHandle, you give up your ability to call certain nexus functions. They are:
- NEXUS_VideoWindow_Close
- NEXUS_VideoWindow_SetSettings

You cannot change a display handle or framebuffer settings while the surface compositor is active.

Typical values for framebuffer.number are:
1: Single buffering results in maximum performance, but there will be tearing on the screen.
2: Double buffering is the default and standard mode.
